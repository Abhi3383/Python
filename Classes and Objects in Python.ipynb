    "### What is `self`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self` is like a pointer or reference to the object (or instance) of the class that is being created or worked on.\n",
    "- It allows the object to store its own data (variables) and use its own methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is `self` important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `self`, Python wouldn’t know if you’re referring to:\n",
    "1. A variable that belongs to the object (instance).\n",
    "2. Or a general variable inside the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a Class Without `self` (Doesn't Work)\n",
    "Here’s what happens if we don’t use `self`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def set_name(name):\n",
    "        name = name  # Oops! This doesn't store the name in the object.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we call `set_name`, it will **not store the name in the object**. Python doesn’t know where to put it because there’s no `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working Example With `self`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how `self` helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Now, the name is stored in the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use this class step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an object:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   p = Person()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the name using the `set_name` method:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   p.set_name(\"Alice\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Here, `self` is the object `p`.\n",
    "   - `self.name` means \"store the name in the object called `p`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Call the `greet` method:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   p.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imagine It Like This\n",
    "Think of `self` as a label for the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p1 = Person()  # p1 is like \"self\" in this context\n",
    "p2 = Person()  # p2 is also \"self\" when working on p2\n",
    "\n",
    "p1.set_name(\"Alice\")\n",
    "p2.set_name(\"Bob\")\n",
    "\n",
    "p1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice\n",
    "p2.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Bob\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you call `p1.set_name(\"Alice\")`, Python translates it to:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  Person.set_name(p1, \"Alice\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `self` is just a name (you could call it anything, but `self` is the convention).\n",
    "2. It refers to the **current object** you’re working with.\n",
    "3. Use `self` to:\n",
    "   - Access or store data in the object (`self.variable`).\n",
    "   - Call other methods of the same object (`self.method()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy: Using a Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have multiple notebooks, each representing a different person.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self` is like saying **“this notebook”**.\n",
    "- You can write inside **this notebook** (`self.name = \"Alice\"`).\n",
    "- Later, you can read from **this notebook** (`print(self.name)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `self`, you wouldn’t know which notebook to use!\n",
    "\n",
